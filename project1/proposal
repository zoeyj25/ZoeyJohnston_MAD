For my project one I want to make an app that is a tutorial for double exposures.
I make double exposures a lot and really enjoy them and people often ask me to teach them how to make them.
I am thinking the app could have two parts like one part that you could see already make double exposures and
get an idea for what is possible and then a category that walks one through how to do it with photos to help.
It would be cool if I could have a third category on importing a photo and doing a basic one in the app, I
have written a code in matlab once that did this but I think it could just be too much work for this time
to also try implement into the app. The main part of my app would really be the tutorial and helping teach
people how to do it. Another way I could do it is have some preset images in the app and have the user pick
any two and then have it show an image from the two they picked.
