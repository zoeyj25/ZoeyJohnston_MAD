Reflection on Project 1
I think my project went well. I thought it looked nice and I really tried
to make it understandable I showed it to a lot of people with no explanation
and changed around a lot of the labels. I made the segues to the other pages
which I was proud of! Weird thing that kept happening was I would make the
segue connection and then say present modally and it would make my one storyboard
as long as the other which I didn’t want and after restarting XCode it magically
worked. I waited too long to deal with auto layout. I have tried a lot with auto
layout and met up with people to try get help on it and I never understood it I
struggled so much and I broke so many apps trying to do auto layout. When we were
presenting I worried a lot if my project was enough. I read the instructions like
a hundred times but when you see a Bluetooth chess game you can’t help but question
if your app is enough. My app worked exactly how I wanted it to and I was really
successful on that, I started on that part really early which was a smart decision
because I didn’t want to turn in a project that didn’t work. If I had to reiterate
this project I would do auto layout and probably work on my gallery more. I spent
so long on the gallery trying to make the pictures show up as the same size and
could not get it I watched video after video and it would not work my images seemed
to be wonky. Maybe I should of used different images but I really wanted to showcase
some of the double exposures I have made into my app.
